# Raw Japanese frequency data

This repository hosts data from [NINJAL: The National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics](https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/).

Use this data to [generate frequency dictionaries for Yomichan](https://github.com/uncomputable/frequency-dict).

All of this data is **already public** on the university website. I host it here in case websites change or links rot.

Be mindful of the different licenses for each data set!

## Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ)

One of the largest and most popular corpora out there. It focuses on written language.

The files are split into SUW (short-unit words) and LUW (long-unit words). Basically, SUW are atomic units and LUW are compound words.

The files come from the [university website](https://clrd.ninjal.ac.jp/bccwj/bcc-chu.html).

## Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ)

Another popular corpus with a focus on spoken language.

There is only an SUW file.

The file comes from the [university website](https://clrd.ninjal.ac.jp/csj/chunagon.html).

## NINJAL Web Japanese Corpus (NWJC)

<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.

A relatively unknown corpus which was created by crawling the web. Compared to BCCJW (2017), this is much newer (2022).

Again, there is only an SUW file.

Getting the original file can be tricky because it is hosted on [NINJAL's repository](https://repository.ninjal.ac.jp/). You have to navigate like so 言語資源 → 国語研日本語ウェブコーパス → 『国語研日本語ウェブコーパス』中納言搭載データ語彙表.

There is an [official website](https://masayu-a.github.io/NWJC/), but it doesn't seem to host any data.

## Corpus of Historical Japanese (CHJ)

<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.

A relatively unknown corpus that covers different eras of Japanese history. _(How cool is that?!)_

The corpus ranges from the Nara period through the Edo period and Meiji era up to the Taishō era.

The files are split between premodern (Nara to Edo) and modern (Meiji to Taishō) sources. There are an SUW and an LUW file for premodern sources, and two SUW files for modern sources.

Again, the original file is hosted on [NINJAL's repository](https://repository.ninjal.ac.jp/). You have to navigate like so 言語資源 → 日本語歴史コーパス → 『日本語歴史コーパス』統合語彙表（バージョン2022.03）.

The [official website](https://clrd.ninjal.ac.jp/chj/chj-wc.html) hosts some data, but the link to the latest version doesn't work and the other versions are outdated.
